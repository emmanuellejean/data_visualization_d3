Summary 
Let's explore the number of survivors compared to the number of victim by class and by gender. 
Data story: 
People travelling in third class had much less chances of surviving during the Titanic catastroph. Let's see if that trend is the same by gender. 
I want to show how third class had much less survivors than the other classes and then emphasis the difference of survivors between gender. 




Design 
1st draft : Index.html

Let's start by a barchart showing the number of survivors and non survivors by class. 
Most of the styling are default styling or the one used in class. 
Three buttons on the righ allow the viewer to see the same barchart but for only men, or only women or come back to the initial barchart with all the gender. 



2nd Version : IndesV2.html

From the first feedback, I need to change to a percentage of survivors/victims by class. Doing so We will lose the information that there is much more people in 3rd class than in 1st or 2nd. 
I realized that the color of the victims and survivors changed depending on which button is clicked. 
I changed the color of the buttons to a more neutral color and added a more rounded rectangle.
I deleted the y axis label




Feedback
1st feed back:  
What is your story? I don't understand it when I look at your chart !
If you want to compare information, first use proportion so I can compare 1st class to the 2nd and the 3rd class. 
Label on the y axis are too small. 
Add information in the charts.
